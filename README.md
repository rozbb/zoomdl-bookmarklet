# Zoom Rec. ⬇️

## Overview

This is a _bookmarklet_ (that is, a bookmark with script inside) that lets you download recorded Zoom calls from the Zoom cloud, regardless of whether the owner has downloads enabled. If it's visible to you, you can download it.

## Why

I like to watch lectures in the park, where there is no WiFi. So now I download the lectures in advance and take them wherever I go.

## Installation and Usage

I can't embed bookmarklets in Github READMEs, so please go to [my website](https://mrosenberg.pub/programming/2020/09/15/zoomdl.html) for installation instructions and how to use it. It's super simple.
